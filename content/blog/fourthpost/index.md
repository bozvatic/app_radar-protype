Seeing that **Christmas** is the most consumption-intensive time of the year, you definitely should ensure that your app is ranked well in app stores. That way consumers can easily find your app as they are searching for that fun game or new media sharing app while cozying up fireside with their friends and family.

{{% text-align %}}## 1. Add Seasonal Keywords{{% /text-align %}}

During this time of the year, people search for holiday-related keywords ~~(seasonal keywords)~~. Depending on what app you have, you can take an advantage of that and them in your listing. If you are still rather new to the app stores, don’t go for highly popular keywords like _“Christmas gifts”_ straight away. Rather focus on keywords with less competition and lower difficulty score – you are far more likely to rank for those. Online tools like _App Radar_ can provide such insights and help you with your choice.

Shopping apps are known to profit a lot from seasonal keywords. But even if you have a game, targeting long tail keywords such as _“holiday game for children”_ can still be a good idea. Think about the functionalities of your app and try to get creative.

During this time of the year, people are usually feeling festive. Your store visuals can help you get some extra attention if they reflect that. You can add a temporary Christmas theme to your store listing as well as update your icon, screenshots or videos. It might be as simple as adding a few snowflakes & Christmas trees emojis to your app title.

Holiday time is also perfect to spread the love among those users who already downloaded your app. You can treat them by adding a special promo code that unlock more functionalities of your app, offer discounts or special offers. The more personal the offer, the better. A great way to inform them about your holiday promotion is through in-app messages or push notifications. If you are not a fan of special offers, you can still connect with your users by simply wishing them happy holidays. Just remember that less is more when it comes to push notifications, so don’t overdo it.

## 4. Make sure to submit your app & updates in time

If your app is available in the Apple app store, you should ensure that all your releases are submitted, approved and scheduled before the annual holiday shutdown. This year the store is closed from _Dec 23 to Dec 27_. That means that you will be able to use the _App Store Connect_ functionalities as usual, but any app updates and new apps will not go live. That is why you should also avoid scheduling any price changes or go-lives for your app during this period. Otherwise, your app will not even be available for users, meaning you will have completely missed the holiday app download rush!
