## What is Paid User Acquisition?

To simplify the process in one sentence, we can say that paid user acquisition covers the actions of promoting your app with money.
This is definitely a fast way to acquire new users because it takes them directly to your app page. Besides that, you can target the audience that you want to reach. You choose the time frame and placement where you want your ads to appear so that you can reach the right audience. However, not every app or mobile game developer has a lot of money to spend on app marketing. We also know that spending money doesn’t guarantee that you are going to get where you want. That’s why we collected some ideas, so you can find out which paid marketing method is best for your product.

## User Acquisition with Video Ads

Internet users are video lovers, this is no secret. Over 8 billion videos are watched on Facebook every day. Thus, we are talking about an investment that brings you at least some return. Apart from that, the video is the perfect way to show how your app or game works. It’s a cool way to show its dynamics, graphics, and usefulness. Remember to make your videos short, visually attractive and to use subtitles.

Your video can show up on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube. The short ads that appear on YouTube before a video is a cheap resource, and also pretty effective since you can decide what type of channels you want to show them and also how much you are willing to pay for each video placement.

## User Acquisition with Social Media Advertising

Social Media is where you are definitely going to find potential users. The only problem is that people keep adding more friends and following more brands, which turns the environment quite crowded. Hence, using ads may be a good option. It isn’t an expensive way, and you can add a “download app button” on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. In addition, you can target similar audiences from your base of users, and you can also target people that like a specific page, or have a specific interest. The possibilities are excellent once you know whom you want to impact.

Facebook Ads Facebook serves you with different types of formats that can really help with your goal. There is even the possibility of running a lead campaign straight on Facebook, so maybe it can save some time from creating a landing page.

On this platform, you choose your goal, such as page visit, conversion, lead generation, etc. Then Facebook charges you each time this action happens. You can choose a daily budget or add a total amount, and Facebook spends it daily aiming at the best results. If you aren’t sure of what works best, the platform allows you to do A/B tests.

Instagram Ads This is definitely one of the most popular social media channels at the moment. Instagram users are even more engaged than Facebook’s audience. Remember that Instagram is a photo platform, so, images and videos are more than welcome for your ads. However, don’t forget to double check if your audience is on Instagram. The majority of the audience is under 30 and there are slightly more women than men. Your ad can show up on Instagram’s feed or/and Stories. The cost of it works just like Facebook’s.

Twitter Ads The best way to promote yourself on Twitter is by using a media card. It can be an image or even a gif. You can optimize your campaigns just like on Facebook, based on your goal. Twitter gives you the possibility of targeting followers of specific pages and also interests. Just remember that Twitter is a fast-paced social media, so prioritize brevity on your ad. On this platform, you have to specify a daily budget.

Snapchat Ads Even though many believed that Snapchat would succumb to Instagram Stories, it didn’t happen. It’s a social media really focused on young people, but the prices aren’t as a good as they are on other platforms. So, it’s a must to research your target audience before going for it. In case you choose Snapchat, remember that your ad should be a video. To run a one-month ad, you would need a budget of around \$1.000,00.
